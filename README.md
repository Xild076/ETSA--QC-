# Entity Targeted Sentiment Analysis (Quantum Criticism)
Part of the Quantum Criticism Research Project with: Assistant Professor David Guy Brizan, Alex Pezcon, and Harry Yin (MAGICS Lab @ University of San Francisco)

## Overview
A unified, graph-centric pipeline for tracking how sentiment attaches to—and evolves around—entities and their aspects within any text. ETSA processes raw sentences one by one, builds a dynamic property graph of entities and descriptive phrases, scores sentiment at multiple levels, and propagates those scores through tunable, explainable message-passing.

## Data Collection

ETSA is currently collecting data to optimize its aggregate sentiment analysis formulas. We would greatly appreciate if you completed the survey here:
