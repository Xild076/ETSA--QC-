We are asking you to participate in a research study titled "Quantum Criticismâ€”Entity-Targeted Sentiment Analysis". We will describe this study to you and answer any of your questions. This study is being led by Harry Yin, a high school research student currently associated with MAGICS Lab at USFCA. The Faculty Advisor for this study is Associate Professor David Guy Brizan, Department of CS at USFCA.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this research is to collect ground truth data on peoples' emotional response towards entities or characters within a text, depending on factors such as how the text is formatted, the intensity of the language, and how the entities/characters interact with each other. The ultimate goal is to use this data in order to develop tools to quantify this phenomenon.

**What we will ask you to do:**
We will ask you to, given a text, to read the text and give each highlighted entity/character within the text a rating on a 9-point scale from -4 (Extremely Negative) to 4 (Extremely Positive) depending on how you feel about the entity/character. There will be 16 questions in the survey and should take at most 10 minutes to complete.

**Risks and discomforts:**
We do not anticipate any significant risks from participating in this research. The given sample text may describe mildly intense situations, but they are brief and fictional. We believe that the risk of discomfort is minimal.

**Benefits:**
We do not anticipate any direct benefits to the participant.

However, we hope to learn more clearly about the way text and textual formatting shapes sentiment. This information may benefit other people now or in the future by mitigating the effects of manipulative language online.

**Incentives for participation:**
There are no inventives for participation.

**Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security:**
The responses are anonymous. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (ex: name, email, or IP address).

Please note that the survey is being hosted by Streamlit, a company not affiliated with USFCA and with its own privacy and security policies that you can find at its website, https://streamlit.io/. We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet.

**Sharing Data Collected in this Research:**
Data from this study may be shared with the research community at large in the form of a paper, presentation, or dataset to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data.

**Taking part is voluntary:**
Participant involvement is completely voluntary. If at any moment the participant may feel uncomfortable with this survey, the participant may withdraw by closing the brower window. If the participant withdraws, any data collected up to that point will not be used.

**If you have questions:**
The main researcher conducting this study is Harry Yin, a high school student currently associated with the MAGICS Lab at USFCA.
